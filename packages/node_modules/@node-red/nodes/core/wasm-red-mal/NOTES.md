Compile with javy 0.6.0is pretty smooth

- `javy compile 70-JSON.js` works
- `wasi` 0.06 works if node version < 20. Yet, we use node 20.01 to solve the issue

Note !!

Invoking Javy-generated modules programatically

Javy-generated modules are by design WASI only and follow the command pattern. Any input must be passed via stdin and any output will be placed in stdout. This is especially important when invoking Javy modules from a custom embedding.


## Roadmap

- Add support for msg, send and done as built-in functions of the compiled Wasm. Since javy uses quickJS we need to add this :(
